Alla schemalagda aktiviteter är på Valhallavägen, första föreläsningen är den 17/3 10.15 i sal D1. All information och allt material finns på kursens sida i Canvas. Jag vill redan nu varna för att tempot tyvärr kommer vara väldigt högt direkt i början av kursen. Deadline för första inlämningsuppgiften är redan 23:59 den 24/3. Orsaken till detta är att alla lektioner måste ligga på måndagar och tisdagar i år, pga av flytten till Valhallavägen. Du kan förbereda dig för kursen genom att installera astah. Det är en editor för att rita diagram, den kommer användas mycket i hela kursen. Installationsanvisningar finns på sidan Astah License. I fortsättningen kommer alla meddelanden om kursen skickas via Piazza, och frågor om kursen ska ställas i Piazza. Registrera dig i Piazza på denna länk, innan kursen börjar. hälsningarLeif Lindbäck\nPosted on:\n\n4 Mar 2025, 09:37","metadata":{"source":"OpenAI/documents/Home.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":37}}}}],["c03c03e6-c52e-4d0f-a3ef-3040c4532302",{"pageContent":"4 Mar 2025, 09:37\n\nU\nunread,Announcements shown on the top of Home\nTo add one or more announcements on the homepage, the course responsible or teacher can click: Settings Course details more options mark \"Show recent announcements on course home page\".

To reach this goal, the course covers fundamental concepts of object-oriented analysis, design and architecture, such as low coupling, high cohesion, encapsulation and polymorphism. The course also gives hands-on experience in using these concepts to design and implement an object-oriented program.\n\n1. Scheduled Activities\nThere are four kinds of activities, lectures, exercises, tutorials and seminars.","metadata":{"source":"OpenAI/documents/Home.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":37,"to":48}}}}],["a4fa694e-f4da-4b32-b7f2-8479033e8ae5",{"pageContent":"Only the first lecture, course introduction, is given live. All other lectures are recorded (in Swedish). Videos and reading instructions are found on the corresponding lecture page which can be reached from Modules.\nThere are a number of exercises, where smaller tasks are solved as a practice for the assignments. These are not mandatory, and no new material is presented. Exercise tasks are found on the corresponding exercise page which can be reached from Modules. Each exercise is scheduled twice in the schema, there's one session 10-12 and another 13-15. The sessions 10-12 are for those who find the topic hard, and want thorough explanations of the basics. The sessions 13-15 are for those who have already grasped the basics, and want more advanced exercises.\nThere are a number of tutorials, where you can ask questions regarding assignments. These are not mandatory, and no new material is presented. Tutorials are scheduled in place at Valhallavägen, but it's also possible to join in zoom. The queuing system stay a while is used to manage the queue for asking questions. Sign up there, and if you're in zoom enter the link to your zoom room in the field Location.\nRemember that there's also Allmänhandledning 11-13 and 17-20 most days.

You're also encouraged to write in Piazza about problems you encountered and have already solved. Your solutions to the problems you faced will most likely be of help to other students.\n\nMind that posts can be anonymous to peer students in Piazza. Only the Instructors are able to see the author of every post.\n\n3. Textbook\nThe course text book, Lindbäck: A First Course in Object Oriented Development, exists only as a pdf which is available here, object-oriented-development.pdfLinks to an external site.. The code examples from the book are included in this NetBeans project, https://github.com/oodbook/code\n\n4.

The grade of this subcourse is also the final grade of the course. The examination consists of seminar tasks, which are reported both orally and in writing, and of additional higher grade tasks, which are reported only in writing.","metadata":{"source":"OpenAI/documents/Home.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":58,"to":71}}}}],["9d1c63b3-0d40-40c3-946e-977f32817055",{"pageContent":"5.1. Seminars\nThe seminars consist of the development of one single object-oriented program, which is reported at five different seminars. The first four seminars concern different activities of object-oriented development. Each of these seminars give 0-2 points, where zero means fail, one means pass and two means pass with distinction. To pass a seminar with distinction (2p) gives one higher grade point. The fifth seminar is an opportunity to re-submit seminars you did not pass or to improve your score for one or more seminars. To pass the course you must pass (one or two points) all seminars.\n\nMore information on seminars and grading is found on the page Seminar Tasks.\n\n5.2. Additional Higher Grade Tasks\nThe additional higher grade tasks are not mandatory. They cover more advanced concepts than the seminars, and contribute to grades A-D. More information, including grading criteria, is found on the page Additional Higher Grade Tasks.\n\n5.3 Grading\nThe requirement to pass the course, with grade E, is to pass all seminars. The additional higher grade tasks and the higher grade points at seminars are proof of sufficient skills to get a higher grade. Therefore, higher grades (A-D) are given based on the number of higher grade points collected from seminars tasks (max 4) and additional higher grade tasks (max 3). The table below shows the grade limits.","metadata":{"source":"OpenAI/documents/Home.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":73,"to":82}}}}],["38be4f27-0a5f-4f9b-95d1-6addd54b2c50",{"pageContent":"Grade limits\nGrade\tRequirement\nE\tPass all seminars\nD\tPass all seminars + 1 higher grade point\nC\tPass all seminars + 3 higher grade points\nB\tPass all seminars + 5 higher grade points\nA\tPass all seminars + 6 higher grade points\nAs an example, consider a student who gets the following results.\n\nSem 1: 2p\nSem 2: 2p\nSem 3: 2p\nSem 4: 1p\nAdditional higher grade tasks: 1p\nThe student passes the course and is eligible for a higher grade, since all seminars are passed (at least 1p at each seminar). The student has got 2p at three seminars, and also completed one additional higher grade task, which gives a total of 3 + 1 = 4 higher grade points. The student thus gets the final grade C.\n\n6.

In addition, if you have special needs, inform the course coordinator and show the certificate from Funka.\n\nSupport actions under code R (i.e. adaptations relating to space, time and physical circumstances) are generally granted by the examiner.\n\nSupport actions under code P (educational adaptation) can be granted or rejected by the examiner after you have applied in accordance with KTH's rules.
